East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low\n
East is up, I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes\n
East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that\n
Dema don't control us, Dema don't control\n
East is up\n
They want to make you forget\n
They want to make you forget\n
Save your razorblades now, not yet\n
Save your razorblades now, not yet\n
I'm heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady\n
I'm lighter when I'm lower, I'm higher when I'm heavy, oh ooh\n
I'm so high, my Jumpsuit takes me so high\n
I'm flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners, oh ooh\n

I'm heavy, jumpsuit is on steady\n
Lighter when I'm lower, higher when I'm heavy, oh\n
I'm so high, I'm so high\n
I'm so high, I'm so high\n
Fire, Nico and the Niners\n
What I say when I want to be enough\n
What a beautiful day for making a break for it\n
We'll find a way to pay for it\n
Maybe from all the money we made razorblade stores\n
Rent a race horse and force a sponsor\n
And start a concert, a complete diversion\n
Start a mob and you can be quite certain\n
We'll win but not everyone will get out\n
No, no\n
We'll win but not everyone will get out\n
No, no\n
We'll win but not everyone will get out

(So keep Ned by you?)\n
Fire, Nico and the Niners\n
